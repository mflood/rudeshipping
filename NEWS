Version 3.1.1-1 - June 29, 2005

	Modified internals beyond recognition

	** Changed package versioning: 
		now using the LIBRARY_VERSION-RELEASE_VERSION
		Release version will be set to 1 for each new lib version
		
	** Rolled the package into binary and source RPMs

Version 2.1

	new method - bool shipping::initialize(const char *config_file_path)
	
		 Previously, the configuration file used for the shipping object
		 was hard-coded to "shipping.cnf".   The initializing sequence of
		 events was hidden within the constructor and the calculate methods.
		 Now, the user must supply the name of the configuration file, and
		 initiate the initialization process hiself.  This allows programs in the
		 same directory to use different configuration files.  This 
		 method must be called before the calculate() method, since it
		 is responsible for building and configuring all of the providers 
		 and services made available in the configuration file.
		 For backwards compatability with existing applications, add
		 this method before you call the calculate() method, and provide
		 "shipping.cnf" as the argument.
		 eg.  
		 		RudeShipping myShipObject;
				myShipObject.initialize("shipping.cnf");
				myShipObject.calculate();
